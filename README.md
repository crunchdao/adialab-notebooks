## How to Use the Notebooks

Feel free to explore the notebooks in this repository to gain insights into different methodologies for market prediction. Each notebook is a self-contained project that you can run 
locally on your machine or experiment with using cloud-based Jupyter services.

To run a notebook locally, you'll need to set up the required dependencies and environment. Typically, the notebooks will require popular Python libraries for data manipulation 
(e.g., Pandas), machine learning (e.g., Scikit-learn), and data visualization (e.g., Matplotlib or Seaborn).
